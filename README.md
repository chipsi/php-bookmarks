# PHP Bookmarks

This is a PHP-based application you can install on your own server.
It is created for saving bookmarks not in the browser but on your server so you can save and access them from any browser you want.

For an easier usage there will be a browser plugin in the future.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository in a repository you want. You must be able to reach this directory via the web.
2. Log into your database and create a new user and a new database the application can use.
3. Grant all priviligues for the databse to the user.
4. Look in the file 'database.php' and fill in the fields.
